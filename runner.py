# Jun 14 Update. I genuinely appreciated the weekend to work on this difficult problem.  
# Unfortunately I have not made much progress on my own. Documentation, challenge review, and CP's youtube have been helpful. But despite that progress has been awfully slow. I managed to get functions 1,2,5, and 6 working. 
# The framework is there, but option 3 (rent video) is only partially complete. The actual assignment and overwriting of CSV values representing stock and rentals keep failing. 
# I'll continue to work on this, but the 8:30 deadline is here so this is my first attempt.
